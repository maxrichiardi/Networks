    "My work is split in two notebooks. Therefore, first you have to read: Marvel - Project 1, then Marvel - Project 2. I explained in my notebook why I decided to split into two works. Please, don't run the second notebook. I'm using the library community and I didn't succeed to seed it. Therefore, if you run it will change my results. Indeed, sometimes there is 5 communities but me I deal with only 4."
